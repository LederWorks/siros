## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

When deploying Siros, please follow these security best practices:

#### 🌐 Network Security
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Configure proper firewall rules
- Restrict database access to application servers only
- Use VPNs or private networks when possible

#### 🔑 Authentication & Authorization
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- Enable multi-factor authentication where available
- Regularly rotate API keys and credentials
- Follow the principle of least privilege

#### 🗄️ Database Security
- Use encrypted connections to PostgreSQL
- Regularly update database software
- Configure proper user permissions
- Enable database audit logging

#### 🐳 Container Security
- Use official container images
- Regularly update base images
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Use non-root users in containers

#### ☁️ Cloud Provider Security
- Use IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Enable cloud provider security features
- Regularly audit cloud configurations
- Use encryption for data at rest and in transit

### For Developers

When contributing to Siros:

#### 📝 Secure Coding
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive data
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

#### 🔍 Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use automated vulnerability scanning
- Review dependency licenses and security advisories
- Pin dependency versions in production

#### 🧪 Security Testing
- Include security tests in your test suite
- Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Use static analysis security testing (SAST) tools
- Perform regular penetration testing

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Authentication**: The current version includes basic authentication. Production deployments should implement proper authentication and authorization.

2. **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints may need additional rate limiting in high-traffic environments.

3. **Input Validation**: While we implement input validation, always review inputs for your specific use case.

4. **Audit Logging**: Consider implementing comprehensive audit logging for compliance requirements.

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] OAuth 2.0 / OIDC integration
- [ ] API rate limiting
- [ ] Enhanced audit logging
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Database encryption at rest
- [ ] Advanced threat detection
